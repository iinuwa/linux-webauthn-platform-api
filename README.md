# Linux Credential Manager API

## Goals

The goal of this repository is to define a spec for clients (apps, browsers,
etc.) to retrieve user credentials in a uniform way across Linux desktop
environments. 

Some high-level goals:

- define an API to securely create and retrieve local credentials
  (passwords, passkeys, security keys)
- create and retrieve credentials on remote devices (e.g. via CTAP 2 BLE/hybrid
  transports)
- Provide a uniform interface for third-party credential providers
  (password/passkey managers like GNOME Secrets, Bitwarden, Keepass, LastPass,
  etc.) to hook into

Some nice-to-haves:
- Design a specification for a platform authenticator. I'm not sure whether this
needs to be specified, or whether it could be considered and implemented as a
first-party credential provider.

Some non-goals:

- Fully implement the proposed specification. This repo is focused on defining
the D-Bus API for clients and portal frontend/backend implementations to use.
Though I would love to help implement, I don't think I will have the time to
securely implement the features specced by the API, so I will rely on others'
expertise to implement. Any implementation in this spec is for reference/experimental purposes and should not be considered production-ready.
- Create a full-featured password manager. Features like Password syncing,
password generation, rotation, etc. is not part of this specficiation. Other
password manager projects should be able to use this to make their credentials
available to the user uniformly, though. 
- BSD support. While I'd love to help out all open desktop environments, I don't
know enough about any BSD to make it useful for them. Hopefully, the design
process is transparent enough that someone else could design something that
works for BSDs.

## Current Work

- Jan 2024: I've defined the [scenarios](doc/scenarios.md) that I expect this
API to cover. I am working on extracting [API methods](doc/api.md) required to
implement the interactions between the client, portal frontend, portal backend,
machine and mobile devices. Once that is done, I intend to convert the API into
a [portal spec](doc/design-doc.md), making it fit normal D-Bus/portal patterns.
