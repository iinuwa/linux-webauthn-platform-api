# Scenario 1: Password (Browser)

1. User opens a website with username and password field.
1. autofill is not enabled
1. user right-clicks to open menu on the username field, browser offers "fill password..." (click 1)
1. browser calls frontend "GetCredential" method, with "type: password" and origin specified
1. user is presented with UI: Do you want to sign into <origin> on <app>? enter fingerprint/device PIN to select credentials
1. user enters credentials. (interaction 2)
1. user is shown a list of credentials, ordered by most relevant based on the origin provided (interaction 3)
1.  user scrolls and selects the relevant credential
1. backend sends ID back to frontend, which pulls the corresponding credential and sends back to client
1. browser receives credentials, fills in username and password.

## Questions
- Can we send extra form fields (for sites that ask for other fields besides username and password)?


# Scenario 2: Passkey (Browser)
1. User opens a website with passkey.
1. autofill is not enabled
1. user clicks passkey button (interaction 1)
1. browser calls frontend "GetCredential" method, with "type: publicKey", origin, and assertion options specified
1. user is presented with UI: Do you want to sign into <origin> on <app>? enter fingerprint/device PIN to select credentials
1. user enters credentials. (interaction 2)
1. backend sends credentials to frontend to verify
1. user is shown a list of credentials, filtered by assertion options and ordered by most relevant based on the origin provided
    - invalid passkeys should not be shown? (because they won't work at all, and for phishing protection), but irrelevant passwords can be shown
    - This may cause issues for some origins if they're not registered properly.
    - Technically, it's the responsibilty of the RP to validate the origin. If the origin is wrong, that's part of the authenticator data, and the RP can reject it. So even if a third-party phisher initiated the assertion from another site, the attacker couldn't use the credentials, because the RP wouldn't recognize the origin. So it might be OK to allow other passkeys to sign the assertion.
1.  user scrolls and selects the relevant credential
1. backend sends ID back to frontend, which pulls the corresponding credential and sends back to client
1. browser receives credentials,

# Scenario 4: Passkey, create-on-the-fly
- not supported by WebAuthn yet

# Scenario 5: Passkey, USB
1. User opens a website with username and password field.
1. autofill is not enabled
1. browser calls frontend "GetCredential" method, with "type: publicKey" and origin specified
1. User clicks passkey button (click 1)
1. user is presented with UI: Do you want to sign into <origin> on <app>? enter fingerprint/device PIN to select credentials. (Or "use a different device (e.g., USB or mobile device)")
1. user clicks on other options (click 2)
1. User clicks on USB (click 3 )
    * this could be done in a different order. If the frontend detects that a FIDO USB device has been connected, then it should signal the backend that it has seen that device. Then the frontend can show the USB device option immediately.
1. Backend shows instructions while waiting for USB
1. User plugs in USB (interaction 4)
1. frontend signals backend that USB was plugged in
1. backend shows instructions to press button
1. user pushes button (interaction 5)
1. frontend signals backend that USB was pressed and sends ref to assertion
1. Backend completes assertion by sending ref back to frontend and closes the window
1. frontend receives assertion ref
1. frontend sends webauthn result to client
